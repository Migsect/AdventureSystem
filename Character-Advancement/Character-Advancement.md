# Introduction

ASSRD throws out the concept of a character class, replacing it with “Advancement Bonuses” and an expanded feat system.  Character bonuses are gained every level to take the place of favored-class bonuses as well as bonuses a class grants every level (such as spell slots and base-attack bonuses.  The expanded feat system will introduce class features as well as more general features.  This allows every class to effectively multiclass.

This replacement system can still build archetype paths, such as the fighter, cleric, and wizard by which players can follow if they desire.  However this is mostly a planned set of feats and character bonuses.

# Advancement Bonuses

Advancement bonuses represent the innate progression of a character.  They can increase the number or strength of spells a character can cast, how skillful a character is, how easily they can hit targets, or how many hits they can take.

For every level gained, a character gains advancment points (AP) equal to 5 plus the level they just gained.  For example, a character advancing to level 6 will earn `10 (5+6)` bonus-points.  Characters may then use these points to purchase different enhancements to their character, some of which may cost multiple points.

|level      |1  |2  |3  |4  |5  |6  |7  |8  |9  |10 |11 |12 |13 |14 |15 |16 |17 |18 |19 |20 |   
|---        |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|AP Earned  |6  |7  |8  |9  |10 |11 |12 |13 |14 |15 |16 |17 |18 |19 |20 |21 |22 |23 |24 |25 |
|Total AP   |6  |13 |21 |30 |40 |51 |63 |76 |90 |105|121|138|156|175|195|216|238|261|285|310|

## Defensive Bonuses

Players may always choose to use their AP to earn pure hitpoint.  The hit points earned no benefit from a player’s constitution, which can be a good or bad thing depending on the value of a player’s constitution.

The global save bonus increases in cost for every time it is purchases.  For example, if the first one is purchases, the next one will be 2.

|Cost   |Level Req.     |Limited?   |Effect         |
|---    |---            |---        |---            |
|1      |1              |No         |+1 hitpoint    |
|1+N    |1              |No         |+1 to all saves|

## Hit Dice

Players may also choose to purchase a hit dice using their points.  Hit dice are variable additional hit points that also benefit from a player’s Constitution modifier when rolled.  

When rolling hit dice for a character, add the player’s CON/DURA modifier to their characters life for every hit dice they have.  For advancing characters, simply add the constitution modifier to the character’s newly rolled value.

A character cannot have more hit dice than their level.

|Cost   |Level Req.     |Limited?   |Effect             |Expected Effect    |
|---    |---            |---        |---                |---                |
|3      |1              |Yes        |+1 1d4 hit dice    |+2.5 + `CON/DURA`  |
|4      |1              |Yes        |+1 1d6 hit dice    |+3.5 + `CON/DURA`  |
|5      |1              |Yes        |+1 1d8 hit dice    |+4.5 + `CON/DURA`  |
|6      |1              |Yes        |+1 1d10 hit dice   |+5.5 + `CON/DURA`  |
|7      |1              |Yes        |+1 1d12 hit dice   |+6.5 + `CON/DURA`  |

## Skill Ranks

For every level a character earns, they will gain skill ranks based on their INT/INTU modifier.  Additionally, a character may purchase additional skill ranks using their advancement points.  Each skill rank costs one AP to acquire.  

Characters may not take more ranks in a skill than their level.

|Cost   |Level Req.     |Limited?   |Effect         |
|---    |---            |---        |---            |
|1      |1              |No         |+1 Skill Rank  |

## Spell Slots

Characters, even if they are spellcasters, do not start with spell slots.  There exists two dimensions that a spell slot can exist in: Spontaneous-Prepared and Divine-Arcane-Natural.  While these do not change the costs of the spell slots, it is required to specify which kind of spell slot is being acquired.

|Cost   |Level Req.     |Limited?   |Effect                     |
|---    |---            |---        |---                        |
|1      |1              |No         |+2 Level-0 Spell Slots     |
|1      |1              |No         |+1 Level-1 Spell Slot      |
|2      |2              |No         |+1 Level-2 Spell Slot      |
|3      |4              |No         |+1 Level-3 Spell Slot      |
|4      |6              |No         |+1 Level-4 Spell Slot      |
|5      |8              |No         |+1 Level-5 Spell Slot      |
|6      |10             |No         |+1 Level-6 Spell Slot      |
|7      |12             |No         |+1 Level-7 Spell Slot      |
|8      |14             |No         |+1 Level-8 Spell Slot      |
|9      |16             |No         |+1 Level-9 Spell Slot      |

Note that spell slots may have their costs reduced by some feats.  Spell slots cannot have their cost reduced by more than half their value rounded up.  For example, a Level-4 Spell Slot can have their cost reduced to a minimum of 2, a Level-5 Spell Slot can have their cost reduced to a minimum of 3.

## Attribute Bonuses

After reaching level 4, 8, 12, 16, 20… (all levels divisible by 4), characters may purchase bonuses to a select attribute score.  A character may only purchase a number of attribute for every 4-levels they have advanced.

|Cost   |Level Req.     |Limited?   |Effect                             |
|---    |---            |---        |---                                |
|3      |*              |Yes        |+0.5 to a Primary-Attribute Score  |
|2      |*              |Yes        |+1 to a Secondary-Attribute Score  |

Do note that characters have a choice between selecting a Primary-Attribute and a Secondary-Attribute.  Primary-Attributes are more general and can modify anything simply uses the primary attribute only.  Secondary-Attributes are more directed, and are cheaper to purchase, but will be specialized into one area.  Secondary-Attributes may be better for characters that know which stat they need while Primary-Attributes are better for generalists.

# Character Feats

Character feats are specializations of a character that may range from additional abilities (such as improved combat maneuvers) to modifying spells.  They replace the idea of class bonuses as well as keep the spirit of feats that players gain as they level.

A player will gain a feat every level in addition to starting with 4 feats to select from (5 feats at level 1).  For every odd level (3, 5, 7, 9, ...), characters gain an additional feat.

|level          |1  |2  |3  |4  |5  |6  |7  |8  |9  |10 |11 |12 |13 |14 |15 |16 |17 |18 |19 |20 |   
|---            |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Feats Earned   |5  |1  |2  |1  |2  |1  |2  |1  |2  |1  |2  |1  |2  |1  |2  |1  |2  |1  |2  |1  |
|Total Feats    |5  |63 |8  |9  |11 |12 |14 |15 |17 |18 |20 |21 |23 |24 |26 |27 |29 |30 |32 |33 |

## Downsides

There are also feats called Downsides.  These often offer the ability for characters to take additional feats in exchange for a downside.  Generally, downsides provide one-half of a regular feat to the character, as such the character must take two downsides to gain one additional feat.

Downsides may also have requirements.  For example, debilitating downsides such as deafness, blindness, or limbless may require a character to be level 1 when taking it (a fresh character).  Characters may gain downsides as required from some effects, however these downsides do not grant the character additional feats.  The idea of some disablement downsides are that the character has been living with the downside for some time and as a result has gain other skills as a result.
