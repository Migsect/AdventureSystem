# Introduction

Adventure System is a roleplaying system that is designed to meet the following ideals:
 - All systems have multiple layers of complexity, of which can be included or discluded depending on the wishes of the players / GM.
 - Multi-classing is built into the fabric of the system such that there are no distinct classes.  However, using the system, classes can be constructed by others.
 - Multi-racing is also built into the system such that races have constraints on how they are designed, created, or developed such that they can be easily be merged.
 - All systems should easily expanded through homebrews.
 - Items should be just as modifyable as everything else and will have like-systems to character creation.

 The idea of adventure system is to have depth while also allowing players to reduce that depth without much complexity or additional literature to do so.  Most systems will make use of nesting structures which aim to achieve this.

 ## Legacy

 Adventure System is heavily based off other d20-systems such as DnD and Pathfinder (Pathfinder is a source and inspiration for many of the systems/feats/rules/etc). Adventure System aims to remove systems that may convoluted as well as merge systems from past systems.
