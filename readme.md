# Adventure System System Rule Documentation (ASSRD)

This repository is a store for all the rule documentation for the Adventure System, an tabletop-RPG system.

Introduction to the rule system: [Introduction](./Introduction.md)

As a note, this repository is going to be structured in a way that it can be easily parsed for documentation display purposes (such as a wiki).  Additionally, structuring file types may be included in the future to ease this process.

All documentation files will be made using Markdown.

Individual sections will be included in their own folder.
